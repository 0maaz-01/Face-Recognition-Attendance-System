# Face Recognition Attendance System

The Face Recognition Attendance System is an application that automates attendance tracking using advanced facial recognition technology. By capturing and identifying student, the system streamlines the attendance process, reduces errors, and enhances efficiency.

The system not only tracks attendance but also maintains a comprehensive database of student details. This includes personal information such as names, student IDs, classes, contact information, etc allowing for easy reference and management.

Users can quickly search for students within the system by using various criteria such as name, student ID, semester or department. This feature ensures that educators can easily access relevant information without extensive manual effort.

## Resources 
1) **Tkinter** library for creating Graphical User Interface (GUI).

2) **OpenCV** library for face detection and recognition using:     
    a) **Haarcascade** algorithm for face detection.  
    b) **LBPH** algorithm for face recognition and training the dataset of images.               

3) **OS** library for reading, writing and opening files and folders.

4) **Datetime** library for retrieving the current date and time when a student's face is recognized.

5) **Pillow** library for manipulating image sizes and opening images.

6) **MySQL Connector** for creating and modifying databases.

7) **Numpy** library for storing and accessing 2d arrays created by LBPH algorithm while converting images to pixel values.

8) **CSV** library for reading and writing CSV files that contain attendance records.

9) The **sys** library is used to determine the system on which the code is running and to set the appropriate options for building a GUI application using **cx_Freeze**.
